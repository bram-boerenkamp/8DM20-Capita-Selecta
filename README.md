## important to note

* _**Never save patient data to this repository i.e., always make sure that your coding directory does not include the data or the results gathered from the data**_
* Make sure to always update your own directory with this git before you start coding.
* When writing new files make sure to add them to this README this makes sure everyone has a understanding of what happens in that file.
* When writing new files also make sure that you're defining global path variables at the top of your file, this ensures that everyone can use your code by simply changing these variables. Also do **not** use full path further down in the code this would make the global variable redundant.
